Team Yoda Phase 1 Submission
===============================
## Setup:
1. Install the rrc_simulation package by following the steps on [this page](https://people.tuebingen.mpg.de/felixwidmaier/realrobotchallenge/simulation_phase/installation.html). Note that in step 1, instead of cloning their repo, you'll want to clone the IPRL fork, and git checkout phase_1_submission. This will create a conda env with all the necessary pacakages (execpt for spinning up, see step 2)
2. Install Krishnan's fork of spinning up baselines.

## Running the code:
### Run full evaluation
### Test with a single sample (best way to visualize a single run)

Real Robot Challenge Simulation
===============================

This repository is exclusively intended for participating
in the [simulation phase of the Real Robot Challenge](https://real-robot-challenge.com/simulation_phase).

For simulating the open-source version of the TriFinger robot, please use the 
repository linked on the official open-source [project website](https://sites.google.com/view/trifinger).


This repository contains a simulation, based on PyBullet, of the TriFinger robot
used in the Real Robot Challenge. In addition, it contains OpenAI gym
environments and evaluation scripts for the tasks of the simulation phase.

For more information on the challenge see:
